HOW TO: flask-sqlalchemy
Keep the "selfDataTest.py" or "__init__.py" open next to you and read along.

How do I start?

1. 	create an instance of the student.
	The initializer arguments: [OSIS,Fname,Lname,password="thisisadefaultpassword"]

$ A = students(1234,"21","Savage")


How do I access a variable?

Getting a student by OSIS:
1. It's a function built into the instance you just made above:

$ B = A.getStudent(1111)

2. This will put the instance of the found student in "B"


How do I change a variable?

$ B.fname = "somerandomnamehere"


What about the password functions you promised?

checkPW --> will check a password --> args: [passwordToCheck]
$ print (B.checkPW("isthispasswordright?")) --> False

modPW --> will change a password --> args: [newPassword]
$ B.modPW("changedPassword")
